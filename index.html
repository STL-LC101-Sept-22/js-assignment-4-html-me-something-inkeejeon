               <h2 id="mainHeading">1998-99 Manchester United</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">This is where it all began. I was first introduced to Man Utd in their FA cup final against Newcastle. Not only this is my sentimental pick, but with their young core, they have dominated during the next few years with style. Oh, and they completed a treble that year!</p>

                        The nostalgia! I was a young kid then. Never got that "Sharp" Jersey.

                  <p>
                     Oh man, this team was my first glimpse of a super team in any sports. By adding David Beckham to their already stacked squad, their line-up sheet was a sight to marvel. However, they have not delivered with results. Money does not guarentee success!

                     Called the Galacticos, probably the most expensive team ever. &euro;&euro;&euro;

               <h2>2000-2001 Inter Milan</h2>
               <p>
                  Saved the best for last. This is the team that I am royal to over all these years, through thick and thin. Christian Vieri is my all-time favorite player. Though Inter would have middling years over the next 5 years, witnessing your own team dominating since, (and for quite a while) is a joy!
